"""

The iris data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris 
flower (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor).

Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width 
of the sepals and petals, in centimetres (iris.data).
Import the iris dataset already in sklearn module using the following command


from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
iris = load_iris()
iris=iris.data

Reduce dimension from 4-d to 2-d and perform clustering to distinguish the 
3 species.
